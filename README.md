# SunbaseDataTask1

We have used dummyData and Script2 for smooth running, although API can be called, it is giving a CORS error. 
To overcome this, each user would need to get temporary access, at https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and change line number 25 of index.html, linking script.js instead of original script2.js
